Gobbles

This is a snake clone written in Java, inspired by Dave Faulkner's Nibbles game for DOS.

My 7-year-old nephew is obsessed with "making video games" on sites like sploder.com, and he knows I write software for a living, so over Christmas break I developed this project to show him what it's like to write a game from scratch.  Mostly this consisted of me making small changes while he watched, and taking feature requests to implement after he went to bed.

It's a dumb little game to show a 7-year-old what making games is like, it's not the greatest piece of software I've ever written and it has no unit tests.  DON'T JUDGE ME.
